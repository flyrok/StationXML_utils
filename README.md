## StationXML_utils ##

A few utilities to mess with StationXML files.  

`staxml_respinfo: plot`  
Plot the instrument response from a StationXML file, report the sensitivity value, and estimate the flat part of the passband.  
The script uses Obspy and its evalresp utilities.  
The response plot defaults to 'Velocity', and the sensitivity units are reported as 'nm/s'. 
The flat part of the passband is estimated by determing where the response is within  Â±5% of 1, after normalizing the response by the sensitivity value.

`make_NRL_inv`  
Make a StationXML file. Response info is pulled from IRIS NRL.

`dataless2inv`  
Convert a dataless seed volume to a StationXML file  

## Install ##

Clone source package  
`git clone http://github.com/flyrok/StationXML_utils`  

Install with pip after download  
`pip install .`  

Or install directly from github  
`pip install git+https://github.com/flyrok/StationXML_utils#egg=StationXML_utils`  

Or just put the executable on your PATH and call directly  
`./staxml_respinfo.py`

## Python Dependencies ##

python>=3.6  (script uses f-strings)  
obspy (https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
-- without this, nothing will work

## Usage ##

To see help:  
`staxml_respinfo --help`    

To see version:  
`staxml_respinfo --version`

To see a list of SEED ids in a StationXML file:  
`staxml_respinfo -i INPUT.staxml`  

To grab the response info for HRV and plot the HHZ response:  
`fdsn_station_info -b 2019001T00 -e 2019100T00 -n IU -s HRV -c "HH?" -r`    
`staxml_respinfo -i sta_info.staxml -s IU.HRV.10.HHZ `    

Which produces:
